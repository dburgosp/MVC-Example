# MVC Example

This project shows a very simple news list, using MVC design pattern as seen in the [Android Applications Architecture](https://www.udemy.com/android-architecture/) course by Vasiliy Zukanov. It uses dependency injection and nested MVC views too.

The app gets a JSON from the sample site https://api.myjson.com/bins/8p7vg, shows the first result with a prominent design and shows the other results into a RecyclerView. When clicking on any result, a WebView with details is shown.
